# Test CP4S Module

## 1. Set up access to IBM Cloud

If running this module from your local terminal, you need to set the credentials to access IBM Cloud.

You can define the IBM Cloud credentials in the IBM provider block but it is recommended to pass them in as environment variables.

Go [here](../../CREDENTIALS.md) for details.

## 2. Test

### Using Terraform client

Follow these instructions to test the Terraform Module manually

Create the file `test.auto.tfvars` with the following input variables, these values are fake examples:

```hcl
// ROKS cluster parameters:
cluster_config_path = "./.kube/config"


region = "cluster_region"
resource_group_name = "resource_group_name"
cluster_id = "cluster_id"


// Entitled Registry parameters:
entitled_registry_key        = "entitled_registry_key"
entitled_registry_user_email = "registry_email"

admin_user = "admin_user"
```

These parameters are:

- `entitled_registry_key`: Get the entitlement key from https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary and assign it to this variable. Optionally you can store the key in a file and use the `file()` function to get the file content/key
- `entitled_registry_user_email`: IBM Container Registry (ICR) username which is the email address of the owner of the Entitled Registry Key
- `admin_user` : user to be given administartor privileges in the default account

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

One of the Test Scenarios is to verify the YAML files rendered to install IAF, these files are generated in the directory `rendered_files`. Go to this directory to validate that they are generated correctly.

## 3. Cleanup

 execute: `terraform destroy`.

There are some directories and files you may want to manually delete, these are: `rm -rf test.auto.tfvars terraform.tfstate* .terraform .kube rendered_files` as well as delete the `cp4na_cli_install` and `ibm-cp-network-automation`
